How we work - Our Code of Conduct

This code was collaboratively generated as part of our induction meeting of our pilot club in Manchester, UK Oct 2017

* Look after ourselves and others in the group
* Use respectful language, especially don’t put down other’s work, be constructive
* Share openly but take care about what of our personal details we put online 
* Use peer learning, be led by your own interests but take an interest in others work and sharing your work. 
* Share when you don’t understand things, and don’t assuming others know about the language and tools you are using
* Celebrate our mistakes as a way of learning
