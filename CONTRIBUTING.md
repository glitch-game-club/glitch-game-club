## What we're working on

### Making Remixable HTML5 Games using Thimble

We are using Phaser.io as our main frame for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at http://thimble.mozilla.org 

Help us to build up a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

There is an example of the Phaser game in Thimble https://thimbleprojects.org/mchesterman/301369/

## Sharing Game Assets and Tutorials on how to make them

This is a good place to link your Roadmap, GitHub Milestones, or Projects so newcomers can see what you're working on.

> Take a look at the issues in our [current milestone](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/milestone/1) or browse some [good first bugs](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/labels/good%20first%20bug) to get started!

Take a look at this [Roadmapping exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/roadmapping/) to start making your own milestones and issues. This will help newcomers (& MozFest attendees!) know where they can help.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
