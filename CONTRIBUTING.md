# Contributing to WebGame Making Clubs

hey! We welcome your contributions to this Game Making Club Resource. This resource aims to suport individuals or coding clubs to make web games with Phaser. This is a volunteer project and we can't do it without your help. This is a fantastically exciting area of emerging practice but there is still a need for user-friendly, beginner resources to get novice game makers, and club volunteers started and motivated. 

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [mick@flossmanuals.net](mailto:mick@flossmanuals.net).

## What we're working on right now

* [Creating Boilerplate Games with Phaser](#creating-boiler-plate--remixable-html5-games-using-thimble)
* [A Blogging / Resource Template](#an-inspirational-html-template-for-blogging-and-documentation)
* [Contribute to our resources on Asset Creating & Facilitation](#sharing-game-assets-and-tutorials-on-how-to-make-them)

## Creating Boiler plate / Remixable Web Games using Glitch

Can you write a simple game demo in Javascript using Phaser? Help us create a resource of simple games which can remixed by club members or used as examples to inspire their own creations. 

We are using Phaser.io javascript game framework as our beginner framework for making HTML5 games and hosting examples at https://glitch.com/.  

Our current [list of remixable starter games are here](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/blob/master/README.md#remixable-web-games-in-glitch)

To volunteer to write a game, [please Sign up here by creating an issue](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/new) or just write a game following our guidelines and test it by doing one of the following. As glitch.com will be the user facing project that our novice coder will see, please test your code there. 

- submit a pull request into the games/ folder and ask us to review your game 
- if possible include a link to a working game on glitch.com
- when approved you or we can move the code to a separate GH repo and create fresh project at glitch.com 

If you just want to send us a link to your game on glitch.com by [including it in an issue that's fine too](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/issues/new)

### Guidelines for Contributing games

Please follow the following guidelines and process when creating your your games.

#### Our Suggested Phaser Game Project Structure

 1. **assets** include images and other assets used by the game in this folder
 2. **js** include your game as one javascript file in the repository in a folder called js please link out to an versions of phaser - our suggested one is <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser-ce@2.11.0/build/phaser.js"></script>
 3. **index.html** Please make index.html a playable version of your game but with a very minimal file 
 
 See [our Coding Guide]( https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/blob/master/CODE_GUIDE.md ) for more info


## An Inspirational HTML template for blogging and documentation
We would love to use this repository and Hugo as our main blogging and documentation platform. We also want our web presense to be as inspirational as the contents of the club. So we are looking for a Web Dev/ Designer to create a Hugo site for us base page, a blogging template and a session documentation template. Could this be you?
See [this issue to find out more and volunteer ](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club/issues/30).
