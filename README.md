# Welcome to the EdLab Game Making Club Resource 

Welcome to the EdLab Game Club Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make.

This project aims to be a network of people to support computer club activities to make games. Together we will create a hub of resources to help this happen. Our particular focus will be on;
[Creating audio, visual and story assets](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets) for video games using free and open tools, [Coding web-based games in Javascript](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club#example-web-games-in-glitch) using Phaser.js, [Fun activities inspiring a creative response to local and global issues (especially “writing / coding in-role”)](http://write.flossmanuals.net/learn-javascript-with-phaser/)

### Remixable Web Games in Glitch

We are actively seeking simple 'boilerplate' games in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to add to this list. See below for details on how to contribute. 

* [Simple Game Created to Be Edited](https://webgameclubs-simple-game-to-edit.glitch.me/)
* [2d Breakout Game by end3r](https://vivid-typhoon.glitch.me/)
* (Using old Thimble system) [Phaser Platform Game Tutorial from Richard and Alvin](https://thimbleprojects.org/piratepete/334344/)
* (Using old Thimble system)  [Intentionally Rubbish Phaser Platform for workshops](https://thimbleprojects.org/davegoopot/417060/)
