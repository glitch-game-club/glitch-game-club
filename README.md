# Welcome to the Glitch Game Making Club Resource 

Welcome to the Glitch Gamemakers Resource. Many thanks for taking the time to look at our project. We hope this is a useful space and thank you in advance for any contribution you can make. We are not sponsored by Glitch.com we just love the tool as a place for our learners to have fun and learn things. 

This project aims to be a network of people to support computer club activities to make games. Together we will create a hub of resources to help this happen. Our particular focus will be on;
[Creating audio, visual and story assets](https://github.com/mickfuzz/mozilla_html5_game_clubs/wiki#creating-game-assets) for video games using free and open tools, [Coding web-based games in Javascript](https://github.com/webgameclubs/edlab-gamemakers-club#example-web-games-in-glitch) using Phaser.js, [Fun activities inspiring a creative response to local and global issues (especially “writing / coding in-role”)](http://write.flossmanuals.net/learn-javascript-with-phaser/)

### Remixable Phaser Web Games in Glitch

We are actively seeking simple 'boilerplate'/ starter games in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to add to this list. Ideally these games will be half-baked in some way. By this we mean games that invite users to dive into the code by hitting remix and fix them or improve them in some way. 

See below for details on how to contribute. 

* [Simple Game Created to Be Edited](https://webgameclubs-simple-game-to-edit.glitch.me/)
* [2d Breakout Game by end3r](https://2d-breakout-end3r.glitch.me/)
* [Simple Pirate Platformer](https://hazards-enemies-vlinted.glitch.me/)
* (Using old Thimble system) [Phaser Platform Game Tutorial from Richard and Alvin](https://thimbleprojects.org/piratepete/334344/)
* (Using old Thimble system)  [Intentionally Rubbish Phaser Platform for workshops](https://thimbleprojects.org/davegoopot/417060/)

We will help learners to be choose their own paths, work collaboratively and be inspired to make fun games with positive messages.
